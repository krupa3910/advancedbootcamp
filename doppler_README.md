To initialize Doppler as part of a python IDE, run the following in your command prompt:

    doppler run -- python

Instead of just running "python" in general. Note: If you normally use python3 as your command you would use "doppler run -- python3" instead. 

Do this after you've completed the setup, instructions for which can be found in the second Advanced Python review session video or in this guide here: https://amazon.awsapps.com/workdocs/index.html#/document/1d3da151998b29b165b84cf089918e2a1956db57a1651c68dc1c969676c97dc9
